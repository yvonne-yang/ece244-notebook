Here you can find my notes for ECE244:Programming Fundamentals (and more generally on C++).  
ECE244 is a course at University of Toronto Computer Engineering. This course teaches basic programming concepts in C++ for people who have learned some C.  
The notes are presented on a Jupyter Notebook with a C++ kernel, so that you can see notes as well as interact with pieces of C++ code.
