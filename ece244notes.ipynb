    "A: From what we've seen in examples, partitioning the problem into smaller parts (T(n/2)) produces a logarithm, whereas multiplying T(n) by 3 would give you exponential growth. Intuitively, these two cancel out so in the end we have O(n), linear time. In this case, we're expanding by a factor of 3 while taking a log of base 2, so we can guess the result to be \\\\(3^{log_2{n}}\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show this formally. For the general case T(n) = c + a\\*T(n/b), we have the expansion:\n",
    "\\\\(T(n) = c + aT(n/b)\\\\ \\quad= c + a(c + aT(\\frac{n}{b^2})) = c + ac + a^2T(\\frac{n}{b^2})\\\\ \\quad= c +ac + a^2(c + aT(\\frac{n}{b^3})) = c+ac+a^2c+a^3T(\\frac{n}{b^3})\\\\...\\\\)\n",

So long story short, the complexity of any recurrence relation of the form \\\\(T(n)=c+aT(n/b)\\\\) is $$O(n^{\\frac{log\\,a}{log\\,b}})$$.
